# Shark Mod
A mod to add shark NPCs to Minecraft.

## Getting Started

This mod is *under development*, if you want to help out please get in contact with me via my email, [tom_aylen@hotmail.com](email:tom_aylen@hotmail.com)

~~At the moment, the mod is in development and the only way to try it is to build from these source files.
Fork or download this repository and use the gradlew script to build the mod.
The .jar file will end up in build\lib folder, move this into the mods folder of your forge installation.~~

## Website
There is a [website](https://Alien2080.github.io/SharkMod), it is mostly pointless besides me having fun and learning.


### Prerequisites
Minecraft 1.14.4

Forge 1.14.4

Java 1.8(8)

### Development logbook
I am keeping a logbook of my development efforts ~~[here](docs/development_logbook.md)~~ Sorry, that would be nicer for reader, but for
my workflow it is easier to dump everything in a [word document](docs/logbook_shark_mod.docx) with terrible spelling and grammar.
